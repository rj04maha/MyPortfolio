The purpose of this website is to display drone photos that people can purchase a digital or hard copy of the photo. I used React for front end and Redux for state management. I am working on building a web server to store data and other uses. I used Heroku for deployment. The project is still underway.",

Each web application is written using PHP scripts that make HTTP requests to the API server and handled by Express routing. The routes are written using asynchronous javascript (async/await) to manipulate data via SQL queries. I used Postman to test and debug the routes. I also worked with and refactored legacy queries using Oracle SQL Developer.",

I used PHP to retrieve data from a MySQL database and to create reusable HTML markup. I used Bootstrap library for styling and it is hosted on my Professor's server. During this course I learned about the request and response processes, the importance of separating an application's content, presentation, and behavior and how to implement a single integrated application using different languages.",
